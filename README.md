# Homework--1

## Description
this is a SEO/marketing companies homepage. They asked me to view their code and create changes to boost seo, accessability, and to overall clean it up and make it more efficient. First of all, I tried to add as many semantic tags as possible. I replaced some of the parent div containers with semantic structrual tags such as header, footer, main, and section. Next, I added alt text to the images in order to increase accessability. I then added a page title which I just named the companies name because that seemed most fitting. The h tags seemed good so I didn't feel the need to make any changes there. Lastly, I cleaned up the css by using more classes. Many of the items within the sections had the exact same styling and formatting added in css, so using id's or differently named classes just added unnecassary lines in css. So I gave the children elements of each section the same classes so that they could just share css properties.
